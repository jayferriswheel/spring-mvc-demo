 * The main entry class of the framework. It will compose event handlers into a
 * {@link EventHandlerGroup} type which implies the dependencies between event
 * handlers. The compose related methods include
 * {@link Sirector#begin(EventHandler...)},
 * {@link Sirector#after(EventHandler...)} and
 * {@link EventHandlerGroup#then(EventHandler...)}. After the transaction is
 * ready by called {@link Sirector#ready()}, We can publish event synchronously
 * by {@link Sirector#publish(Object)} or asynchronously by
 * {@link Sirector#publish(Object, Callback)} to invoke a transaction.
 *
 * Following is a simple example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
 * Sirector sirector = new Sirector(executor);
 * HandlerA a = new HandlerA();
 * HandlerB b = new HandlerB();
 * HandlerC c = new HandlerC();
 * sirector.begin(a, b);
 * sirector.after(a,b).then(c);
 * sirector.ready();
 * Event e = new Event();
 * Event result = sirector.publish(e);
 *
 * class Event{
 * 	   ....
 * }
 *
 * class HandlerA implement EventHandler<Event>{
 *
 * }
 *
 * class handlerB implement EventHandler<event>{
 *
 * }
